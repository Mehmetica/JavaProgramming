//You can cretae multiple classes in one class. only the one which has the class name
// can   have the "public" access modifier and rest of them can get default modifier
// "class" only.When you want to share your code in one class, you can create multiple
// classes in one page.Not a prefered way!!
//1. Complete your code in seperate classes and create a new class under "src" and
// create your new default and public classes into this new class
//After sharing your code delete this class!!
